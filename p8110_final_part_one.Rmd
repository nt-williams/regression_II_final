*Data import and preparation*

```{}
proc import out = depression 
  datafile = "~\final\regression_II_final\data.csv"
	dbms = csv replace; 
	getnames = yes; 
run; 

data depression; 
	set depression; 
	rename PARDEP = parent_dep
		   DSMDEPHR = child_dep
		   PTSEX = child_sex
		   PTAGE = child_age
		   BEDEPON = age_child_dep
		   DSMSUBHR = sub_abuse_child
		   BESUBON = age_sub_child
		   SESCLASS = ses_parent
		   MSPARENT = mar_stat_parent; 
run;
```

1. I defined the start time as the time of birth for all children. The end time was defined as either the age of onset of depression in children that were classified as ever having depression or as the age at child interview for children that classified as never having depression. To hold this survival time, I created a variable called `follow_time`:

```{}
data depression;
	set depression; 

	if child_dep = 1 then 
		follow_time = age_child_dep; 
	else if child_dep = 0 
		then follow_time = child_age; 
run; 
```

2. 

```{}
proc means data = depression median clm maxdec = 2; 
	var age_child_dep;
	class parent_dep; 
	where child_dep = 1;
run;
```

3. 

4. 

```{}
proc lifetest data = depression method = km conftype = loglog stderr plots = survival(cl);
	strata parent_dep;  
	time follow_time * child_dep(0); 
run; 
```
